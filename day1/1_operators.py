# Like in any other programming language python also has it's set of operators
# Operators in python are:
# 1. Arithmetic Operators
# 2. Logical Operators
# 3. Relational Operators
# 4. Assignment Operators
# 5. Membership Operator
# 6. Identity Operator


# 1. Arithmetic Operators

# Addition(+)
a = 1  # a is a variable; = is an operator and 1 is a data of integer type
b = 2
print(a + b)  # print() is a python built-in function to view the results in a consoleb = 
# Subtraction
a = 5
b = 3
print(a -b)
# Division (/)
# Multiplication (*)
# Exponent (**)
# Floor Division (//)
# Modulus Operator (%)

# 2. Logical Operators
# and, or, not
print (True and False)
print (not False)
print (not True)
# 3. Relational Operators
# >, <, >=,<=, !=, ==
# Result is in boolean (True/False)
# 4. Assignment Operators
# =, +=, -=, *=
a=1
a+=1
print (a)
# 5. Membership Operators
# in, not in
# result in boolean
# checks whether an element is a member of iterable
# Iterable means sequence of data
Vowels = ("a", "e", "i", "o", "u")
print ("b" in Vowels)
# 6. Identity Operators
# is and is not
# to check if the objevts are same or not
a=1
b=a
print (a is b)
